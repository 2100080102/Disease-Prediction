# Disease-Prediction
# **Overview**


This project, "Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning" is aimed at developing a system to predict diseases based on symptoms. The system leverages Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to provide accurate disease predictions. 

# **Objectives**


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Develop a methodology to predict diseases based on the symptoms provided by users.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Aid in the early detection of diseases to prevent unwarranted casualties.


# **Technologies Used**
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Machine Learning (ML)
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Deep Learning (DL)
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Data Mining
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Decision Trees

# **System Architecture**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is divided into several components:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Data Mining:** Preprocessing and feature extraction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Machine Learning Models:** Training and prediction using decision trees.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **User Interface:** Collecting symptoms from users and displaying predictions.

# **Components of the User Interface**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Name of the Patient:** A text box where the user can enter the patient's name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Symptom 1 to Symptom 5:** Drop-down menus where the user can select up to five symptoms from predefined options. These symptoms will be used by the machine learning model to predict possible diseases.

## **Prediction Buttons**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Decision Tree:** A button to use the Decision Tree algorithm for disease prediction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Random Forest:** A button to use the Random Forest algorithm for disease prediction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Naive Bayes:** A button to use the Naive Bayes algorithm for disease prediction.

## **Output Area**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the buttons, there are empty text fields where the predicted disease will be displayed once a prediction algorithm is selected and executed.

# **Explanation of Usage**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Input the name of the patient in the designated text box.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Use the drop-down menus to select up to five symptoms that the patient is experiencing. The symptoms are likely predefined and available in the drop-down options.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Click on one of the buttons (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) to predict the disease based on the selected symptoms.  Each button represents a different machine learning model, providing different prediction approaches.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The prediction results, which may include the probable disease, will appear in the empty text fields below the symptom inputs and prediction buttons.


## **Disclaimer**

This system does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Predictions are based on input symptoms and may not always be accurate. Designed for educational purposes and preliminary analysis only. The system uses three models that may offer varying predictions due to accuracy differences and algorithms. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
